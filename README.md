Deploy a webpage on GitHub pages. The webpage will make 4 API calls:

The first API call is to get your public IP address
The second API call uses the result of the first API call as a variable to find your location.
The third API call again uses the result of the first API call as a variable to find the weather at your location.
The fourth API uses the result of the second API call as a variable to find the weather at your location.
