- Deploy a webpage on GitHub pages. The webpage will make 4 API calls:

1. The first API call is to get your public IP address
2. The second API call uses the result of the first API call as a variable to find your location.
3. The third API call again uses the result of the first API call as a variable to find the weather at your location.
4. The fourth API uses the result of the second API call as a variable to find the weather at your location.
